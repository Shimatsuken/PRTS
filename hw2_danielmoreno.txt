/*
* File: hw2_danielmoreno.c
* Author: Daniel Moreno
* Date: 1/26/2023
* Purpose: Write a program that keeps asking the user to supply an integer as input until the user tells the program to stop by entering q. It will then print out the positive integers entered, the number of negative integers entered, and the sum of all integers entered.
* Sources of help: Nolan Trapp, we discussed how to declare 'int' and touched on 'vim' usage. I also spoke to Professor France concerning the '==1' part of my code.
